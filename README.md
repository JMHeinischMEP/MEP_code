# MEP_code
In this Github repository, the code used in my Master's thesis is stored. Before running the code for the simple helix, it is necessary to import the files stored in the folder 'Auxiliary functions'. These files store functions necessary to generate the geometry of this helix and functions necessary for computing integrals in a higher-order method. Similarly, for simulating the sublattice symmetric structures, the code stored in Sublattice_symm/Geometry generators has to be run, since this code contains functions for generating the interactions for these geometries.
